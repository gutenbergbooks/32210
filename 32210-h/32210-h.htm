<h2>THE BROWNIES' RIDE.</h2>


<div class='poem3'>

<img src="images/i008b-o.png" width="272" height="203" alt="O" title="" />
</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NE night a cunning Brownie band<br />
Was roaming through a farmer's land,<br />
</div>
<div class='poem'>
And while the rogues went prying 'round,<br />
The farmer's mare at rest they found;<br />
And peeping through the stable-door,<br />
They saw the harness that she wore.<br />
The sight was tempting to the eye,<br />
For there the cart was standing nigh.<br />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 114px;">
<img src="images/i008c.png" width="114" height="173" alt="Looking through the door" title="" />
</div>

<div class='poem2'><br />
"That mare," said one, "deserves her feed&mdash;<br />
Believe me, she's no common breed;<br />
Her grit is good: I've seen her dash<br />
Up yonder slope without the lash,<br />
Until her load&mdash;a ton of hay&mdash;<br />
</div>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/i008d.png" width="174" height="152" alt="Looking at the gear" title="" />
</div>
<div class='poem'>Went bouncing in beside the bay.<br />
In this same cart, old Farmer Gill<br />
Takes all his corn and wheat to mill;<br />
It must be strong, though rude and rough;<br />
It runs on wheels, and that's enough."<br />
</div>



<div class='poem'><br />
Now, Brownies seldom idle stand<br />
When there's a chance for fun at hand.<br />
</div>

<img src="images/i009a.png" width="251" height="121" alt="Pulling the rope" title="" />
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
So plans were laid without delay;<br />
The mare was dragged from oats and hay,<br />
The harness from the peg they drew,<br />
And every one to action flew.<br />
It was a sight one should behold<br />
To see them working, young and old;<br /></div>
<div class='poem3'>
Two wrinkled elves, like leather browned,<br />
Whose beards descended near the ground,<br />
Along with youngsters did their best<br />
With all the ardor of the rest.<br />

<img src="images/i009b.png" width="462" height="456" alt="With the horse" title="" />
</div>
<div class='poem'>
While some prepared a rein or trace,<br />
Another slid the bit in place;<br />
More buckled bands with all their might,<br />
Or drew the harness close and tight.<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/i010.png" width="471" height="454" alt="Harnessed to the cart" title="" />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
When every strap a buckle found,<br />
And every part was safe and sound,<br />
Then 'round the cart the Brownies flew,&mdash;<br />
The hardest task was yet to do.<br />
It often puzzles bearded men,<br />
Though o'er and o'er performed again.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
Some held the shafts to steer them straight,<br />
More did their best to balance weight,<br />
While others showed both strength and art<br />
In backing Mag into the cart.<br />
At length the heavy job was done,<br />
And horse and cart moved off as one.<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/i011a.png" width="421" height="135" alt="All in a row" title="" />

<div class='poem'>
Now down the road the gentle steed<br />
Was forced to trot at greatest speed.<br />
</div>

<img src="images/i011b.png" width="218" height="125" alt="Pulled behind" title="" />

<div class='poem2'>
A merrier crowd than journeyed there<br />
Was never seen at Dublin Fair.<br />
Some found a seat, while others stood,<br />
Or hung behind as best they could;<br />
While many, strung along, astride,<br />
Upon the mare enjoyed the ride.<br />
The night was dark, the lucky elves<br />
Had all the turnpike to themselves.<br />
No surly keeper barred the way,</div>

<div class='poem'>

For use of road demanding pay,<br />
Nor were they startled by the cry<br />
Of robbers shouting, "Stand or die!"<br />
Across the bridge and up the hill<br />
And through the woods to Warren's mill,&mdash;<br />
A lengthy ride, ten miles at least,&mdash;<br />
Without a rest they drove the beast,<br />
And then were loath enough to rein<br />
Old Mag around for home again.<br />

<img src="images/i012b.png" width="242" height="175" alt="Watching it go by" title="" />
</div>
<div class='poem'>
Because the feed of oats and hay<br />
Unfinished in her manger lay.<br />
So through the yard she wheeled her load<br />
As briskly as she took the road.<br />
No time remained to then undo<br />
The many straps which tight they drew.<br />
For in the east the reddening sky<br />
Gave warning that the sun was nigh.<br />

And chased the dog across the farm,<br />
Because it failed to give alarm.<br />

Who stole the ride he never knew.<br />

The lion rose with sudden leap,<br />

With lifted mane, roared loud with rage,<br />
And thrust its paws between the bars,<br />
Until it seemed to shake the stars,&mdash;<br /></div>

<h2>THE BROWNIES' CIRCUS.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>One</span> night the circus was in town<br />
With tumbling men and painted clown,<br />
And Brownies came from forest deep<br />
Around the tent to climb and creep,<br />
And through the canvas, as they might<br />
Of inner movements gain a sight.<br />

<div class='poem'>
With such remarks away they went<br />
At this or that around the tent;<br />
The wire that not an hour before<br />
The Japanese had traveled o'er<br />
From end to end with careful stride,<br />
Was hunted up and quickly tried.<br />
Not one alone upon it stepped,<br />
But up by twos and threes they crept,<br />
Until the strand appeared to bear<br />
No less than half the Brownies there.<br />
Some showed an easy, graceful pose,<br />
But some put little faith in toes,<br />
And thought that fingers, after all,<br />
Are best if one begins to fall.<br />
<br />
When weary of a sport they grew,<br />
Away to other tricks they flew.<br />
They rode upon the rolling ball<br />
Without regard to slip or fall;<br />
Both up and down the steep incline<br />
They kept their place, with balance fine,<br />
Until it bounded from the road,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>And whirled away without its load.<br />
They galloped 'round the dusty ring<br />
Without a saddle, strap or string,<br />
And jumped through hoops both large and small,<br />
And over banners, poles and all.<br />
<br />
In time the elephant was found<br />
And held as though in fetters bound;<br />
Their mystic power controlled the beast,&mdash;<br />
He seemed afraid to move the least,<br />
But filled with wonder, limp and lax,<br />
He stood and trembled in his tracks,<br />
While all the band from first to last<br />
Across his back in order passed.<br />

So thus they saw the moments fly<br />
Till dawn began to paint the sky;<br />
And then by every flap and tear<br />

To reach their hiding-place at last.<br />

HILE Brownies once were rambling through<br />
A forest where tall timber grew,<br />
The hum of bees above their head<br />
To much remark and wonder led.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">They gazed at branches in the air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And listened at the roots with care,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And soon a pine of giant size</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Was found to hold the hidden prize.</span><br />
Said one: "Some wild bees here have made<br />
Their home within the forest shade,<br />
Where neither fox nor prying bear<br />
Can steal the treasure gathered there."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Another spoke: "You're quick and bright,</span><br />

As straight as runs the county line.<br />

To-morrow night we'll muster here,<br />

They simply kept their canvas spread,<br />
And steered the vessel straight ahead.<br />
The birds were distanced in the race;<br />
The gar and shark gave up the chase,<br />
And turning back, forsook the keel,<br />
And lost their chances of a meal.<br /></td></tr>

For now the ship to ruin flew,<br />
As though it felt its work was through,<br />
And soon it stranded, "pitch and toss,"<br />
Upon the rocks, a total loss.<br />
The masts and spars went by the board&mdash;<br />
The hull was shivered like a gourd!<br />
But yet, on broken plank and rail,<br />
On splintered spars and bits of sail<br />
That strewed for miles the rugged strand,<br />
The Brownies safely reached the land.<br />

Now, Brownies lack the power, 'tis said,<br />

To build and launch the ship again;&mdash;<br />

That Brownie band for years was found.<br />

</div>
<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Once</span> while the Brownies lay at ease<br />
About the roots of rugged trees,<br />
And listened to the dreary moan<br />
Of tides around their island lone<br />
Said one: "My friends, unhappy here,<br />
We spend our days from year to year<br />
We're cornered in, and hardly boast<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>A run of twenty leagues at most<br />
You all remember well, I ween,<br />
The night we reached this island green,<br />
When flocks of fowl around us wailed,<br />
And followed till their pinions failed.<br />
And still our ship at every wave<br />
To sharks a creaking promise gave,<br />
Then spilled us out in breakers white,<br />
To gain the land as best we might.<br />
Since then how oft we've tried in vain<br />
To reach our native haunts again,<br />
Where roaming freely, unconfined,<br />
Would better suit our roving mind.<br />
<br />
"To-night, while wandering by the sea<br />
A novel scheme occurred to me,<br />
As I beheld in groups and rows<br />
The weary fowl in deep repose.<br />
They sat as motionless as though<br />
The life had left them years ago.<br />
The albatross and crane are there,<br />
The loon, the gull, and gannet rare.<br />
An easy task for us to creep<br />
Around the fowl, while fast asleep.<br />
And at a given signal spring<br />
Aboard, before they spread a wing,<br />
And trust to them to bear us o'er.<br />
In safety to our native shore."<br />
<br />
Another spoke: "I never yet<br />
Have shunned a risk that others met,<br />
But here uncommon dangers lie,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>Suppose the fowl should seaward fly,<br />
And never landing, course about,<br />
And drop us, when their wings gave out?"<br />
<br />
To shallow schemes that will not bring<br />
A modest risk, let cowards cling!<br />
The first replied. "A Brownie shows<br />
The best where dangers thickest close.<br />
But, hear me out: by sea and land,<br />
Their habits well I understand.<br />
When rising first they circle wide,<br />
As though the strength of wings they tried,<br />
Then steering straight across the bay,<br />
To yonder coast a visit pay.<br />
But granting they for once should be<br />
Inclined to strike for open sea,<br />
The breeze that now is rising fast,<br />
Will freshen to a whistling blast,<br />
And landward sweeping, stronger still,<br />
Will drive the fowl against their will."<br />

We'll take position, come what may,<br />
And celebrate the Nation's Day."<br />
<br />
That eve, when stars began to shine,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>The eager band was formed in line,<br />
And, acting on the plans well laid,<br />
A journey to the town was made.<br />
<br />
The Brownies never go astray,<br />
However puzzling is the way;<br />
With guides before and guards behind,<br />
They cut through every turn and wind,<br />
Until a halt was made at last<br />
Before a building bolted fast.<br />
But those who think they'd turn around<br />
And leave because no keys are found<br />
Should entertain the thought no more,<br />
But study up the Brownie lore.<br />
<br />
They rummaged boxes piled around<br />
And helped themselves to what they found,<br />
Some eager to secure the wheel<br />
That would so many sparks reveal.<br />
Some active members of the band<br />
To bombs and crackers turned their hand,<br />
While more those emblems sought to find<br />
That call the Nation's birth to mind,<br />
And bring from every side the shout<br />
When all their meaning blazes out.<br />

Ere long, upon the homeward road<br />
They hastened with their novel load:<br />
And when the bell in chapel tower<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>Gave notice of the midnight hour,<br />
The ruddy flame, the turning wheel,<br />
The showering sparks and deafening peal<br />
Showed Brownies in the proper way<br />
Gave welcome to the glorious day.<br />

Some plasters would have served the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; band<br />
Much better than the goods on &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  hand;<br />

It caught the jokers &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unaware.<br /></div>

At times, in spite of warning &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cries,<br />

Some ears were stunned, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  some noses got<br />
Too close to some-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thing quick and hot,<br />
And fingers bore &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for days and weeks<br />

Some dodging 'round  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;would get a share<br />

And with a  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;black or speckled face<br />

They ran about from place to place,<br />
To find new dangers blaze and burn<br />
On every side where'er they'd turn.<br />
<br />
But few were there who felt afraid<br />
Of bursting bomb or fusillade,<br />
And to the prize they'd stick and hang<br />
Until it vanished with a "bang,"<br />
Or darting upward seemed to fly<br />
On special business to the sky.<br />

<h2>THE BROWNIES IN THE TOY-SHOP.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>As shades</span> of evening settled down,<br />
The Brownies rambled through the town,<br />
To pry at this, to pause at that;<br />
By something else to hold a chat,<br />

Express themselves in language plain.<br /></div>

<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And toys of rubber piled within.</span><br />

Said one, "In all our wandering 'round,<br />
A sight like this we never found.<br />
When such a passing glimpse we gain,<br />
What marvels must the shelves contain!"<br />
<br /></div><div class='poem5'>
Another said, "It must be here<br />
Old Santa Claus comes every year<br />
To gather up his large supply,<br />
When Christmas Eve is drawing nigh,<br />
That children through the land may find<br />
They still are treasured in his mind."<br />

A third remarked, "Ere long he may<br />
Again his yearly visit pay;<br />
Before he comes to strip the place,<br />
We'll rummage shelf, and box, and case,<br />
Until the building we explore<br />
From attic roof to basement floor,<br />
And prove what pleasure may be found<br />
In all the wonders stowed around."<br />

Not long were they content to view<br />
Through dusty panes those wonders new:<br />
And, in a manner quite their own,<br />
They made their way through wood and stone.<br />
<br />
And then surprises met the band<br />
In odd conceits from every land.<br />
Well might the Brownies stand and stare<br />
At all the objects crowded there!<br />
Here, things of gentle nature lay<br />
In safety, midst the beasts of prey;<br />
The goose and fox, a friendly pair,<br />

While ships of war, with every sail<br />
Unfurled, were anchored to a nail;<br />
There soldiers stood in warlike bands;<br />
And naked dolls held out their hands,<br />
As though to urge the passers-by<br />
To take them from the public eye.<br />
This way and that, the Brownies ran;<br />
To try the toys they soon began.<br />

With wig and night-cap in their place,<br />
To give some customer a start<br />
When next the jumper flew apart.<br />
The trumpets, drums, and weapons bright<br />
Soon filled them all with great delight.<br />
Like troops preparing for their foes,<br />

They danced with dolls a lively round.<br />

There fish were working tail and fin<br />
In seas confined by wood and tin;<br />
The canvas shark and rubber whale<br />
Seemed ill content in dish or pail,<br />
And leaping all obstructions o'er<br />
Performed their antics on the floor.<br />

Some found at marbles greatest fun,<br />
And still they played, and still they won,<br />
Until they claimed as winners, all<br />

'Twas hardly missed in such a store,<br />
With wonders fairly running o'er:<br />
To something else about the place<br />
The happy Brownie turned his face,<br />
And only feared the sun would call<br />
Before he'd had his sport with all.<br />
<br />
Thus, through the shop in greatest glee,<br />
They rattled 'round, the sights to see,<br />
Till stars began to dwindle down,<br />
And morning crept into the town.<br />
And then, with all the speed they knew,<br />
Away to forest shades they flew.<br />
